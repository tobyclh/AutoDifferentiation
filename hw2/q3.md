## Q3
Euler method is generally superior in terms of computational speed. It only evaluate the deritative of the function once per execution. In contrast, Kurger method evaluates the derivative 4 times per execution.  
Euler method evaluates the derivative of the function only at the point of sampling ($x_n$), but Kurger method evaluates the current point and also intermediate points between $x_n$ and $x_{n+1}$ to create a better approximation. This is particularly critical when the derivative of the function change rigorously or the sampling interval is high (i.e. sample point are sparse).  
In both methods, decreasing sampling interval (i.e. denser sampling) improves the accuracy.
